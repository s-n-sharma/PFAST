## Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd src/location_pfas
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**

   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start

Search for water sites with ML safety analysis:
```bash
python main.py --zipcode 10001
```

Search with custom radius and safety analysis:
```bash
python main.py --zipcode 90210 --radius 50
```

Search without safety analysis (faster):
```bash
python main.py --zipcode 10001 --no-safety
```

### Interactive Mode

Run the system interactively:
```bash
python main.py --interactive
```

In interactive mode, you can use these commands:
- `search 10001` - Search for sites near zipcode 10001 with safety analysis
- `search 10001 50 --no-safety` - Search with 50-mile radius without safety analysis
- `summary` - Show PFAS data summary
- `model_info` - Show ML model information
- `train_model` - Train the safety prediction model
- `help` - Show help information
- `quit` - Exit the program

### ML Model Management

Train the safety prediction model:
```bash
python main.py --train-model
```

View model information:
```bash
python main.py --model-info
```

### Data Summary

View a summary of the PFAS data:

## ML Safety Prediction System

### How It Works

The system uses **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks** to predict water safety based on PFAS concentrations:

1. **Data Compilation**: Creates comprehensive training data with realistic PFAS concentration scenarios
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features from PFAS compound data
3. **Dual Model Approach**: 
   - **Classification Model**: Categorizes safety levels (Safe, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk)
   - **Regression Model**: Predicts continuous safety scores
4. **Risk Assessment**: Combines predictions with EPA guidelines for comprehensive risk analysis

### Safety Metrics

- **Safety Score**: Continuous value (lower = safer)
- **Risk Levels**: Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk
- **Priority Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Confidence Scores**: Model confidence in predictions (0-100%)
